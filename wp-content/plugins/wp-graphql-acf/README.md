WP GraphQL ACF
===============

## NOTE: This plugin is in early stages and is not quite ready for use.

This plugin is an add-on for the awesome [WP GraphQL][wp-graphql]

It builds on top of WP GraphQL. Any
meta data you register using Advanced Custom Fields will be available
to retrieve in your results. You get your data in GraphQL API.

## Installing

1. Make sure that [WP GraphQL][wp-graphql] is installed and activated first.
2. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

## Usage

Your theme or other plugins may use meta data to add custom functionality. That
data or functionality can be beneficial / required for a front end or
other app that consumes your API.
